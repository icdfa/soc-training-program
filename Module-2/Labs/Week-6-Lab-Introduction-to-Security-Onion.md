# Week 6 Lab: Introduction to Security Onion

## Objective

To install and configure Security Onion in your virtual lab and use it to detect and analyze malicious traffic.

## Scenario

You are a SOC analyst and your team has just deployed Security Onion as its new NSM platform. Your manager has asked you to familiarize yourself with the tool by installing it in your lab and running some test attacks against a vulnerable target.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Install Security Onion

1. Download the latest version of the Security Onion ISO from the official website.
2. Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox or VMware.
3. Configure the virtual machine with at least 4GB of RAM and two network adapters:
   - **Adapter 1 (Management):** Bridged to your physical network adapter.
   - **Adapter 2 (Monitoring):** Connected to a SPAN or mirror port on your virtual switch (or a dedicated host-only network that your target machines are on).
4. Install Security Onion on the virtual machine by following the official documentation.

### Part 2: Generate Malicious Traffic

1. Download and set up a Metasploitable 2 virtual machine in your lab.
2. Use your Kali Linux machine to run a vulnerability scan against the Metasploitable machine using a tool like Nmap or Nessus.
3. Use Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability on the Metasploitable machine and gain a shell.

### Part 3: Analyze the Alerts in Security Onion

1. Log in to the Security Onion web interface.
2. Navigate to the "Alerts" dashboard.
3. Analyze the alerts generated by the vulnerability scan and the Metasploit exploit.
4. Pivot from the alerts to the full packet capture to see the raw traffic.

## Deliverables

- Screenshots of the alerts generated in Security Onion.
- A brief write-up explaining the alerts and what they mean.
- A screenshot of the full packet capture for one of the alerts.
