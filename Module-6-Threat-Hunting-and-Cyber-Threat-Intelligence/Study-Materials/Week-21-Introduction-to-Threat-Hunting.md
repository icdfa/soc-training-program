# Week 21: Introduction to Threat Hunting

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Module 6: Threat Hunting and Cyber Threat Intelligence! This week, we will introduce the concept of threat hunting, its importance in a modern SOC, and the methodologies used by threat hunters.

## 2. What is Threat Hunting?

Threat hunting is the proactive search for cyber threats that are lurking undetected in a network. Unlike traditional threat detection, which is reactive, threat hunting assumes that a breach has already occurred and seeks to find the evidence.

## 3. Threat Hunting Methodologies

- **Hypothesis-Driven Hunting:** Starting with a hypothesis about a potential threat and then searching for evidence to support or refute it.
- **Intelligence-Driven Hunting:** Using threat intelligence to guide the hunt for specific threat actors or campaigns.
- **Analytics-Driven Hunting:** Using machine learning and data analysis to identify anomalies and outliers that may indicate a threat.

## 4. The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

The Diamond Model is a framework for analyzing and understanding cyber intrusions. It consists of four core components:

- **Adversary:** The threat actor behind the attack.
- **Infrastructure:** The infrastructure used by the adversary.
- **Capability:** The tools and techniques used by the adversary.
- **Victim:** The target of the attack.
