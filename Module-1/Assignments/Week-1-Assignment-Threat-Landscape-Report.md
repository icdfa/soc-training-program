# Week 1 Assignment: Threat Landscape Report

## Objective

To research and report on a specific threat actor or malware family, and to understand their common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

## Scenario

You are a threat intelligence analyst at a major financial institution. Your manager has asked you to create a report on the threat actor FIN7, which is known for targeting the financial sector.

## Instructions

1. **Research FIN7:**
   - Use open-source intelligence (OSINT) to gather information about the threat actor FIN7.
   - Focus on their history, motivations, common targets, and TTPs.

2. **Write a Threat Actor Report:**
   - Create a new Markdown document named `FIN7-Threat-Actor-Report.md`.
   - Your report should include the following sections:
     - **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the threat actor.
     - **History and Motivation:** A brief history of the group and their likely motivations.
     - **Targets:** The types of organizations and industries that FIN7 typically targets.
     - **TTPs:** A detailed breakdown of the TTPs used by FIN7, mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
     - **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):** A list of known IOCs associated with FIN7, such as IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes.
     - **Recommendations:** Recommendations for how your organization can defend against FIN7.

## Deliverables

- A Markdown document (`FIN7-Threat-Actor-Report.md`) containing your threat actor report.
