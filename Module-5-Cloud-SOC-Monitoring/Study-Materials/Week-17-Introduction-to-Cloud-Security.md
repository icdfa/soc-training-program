# Week 17: Introduction to Cloud Security

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Module 5: Cloud SOC Monitoring! This week, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of cloud security and how they differ from traditional on-premises security. We will explore the major cloud service providers (CSPs) and their security models.

## 2. Cloud Service Models

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Provides software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.

## 3. Cloud Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud:** Owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider.
- **Private Cloud:** Used exclusively by a single business or organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them.

## 4. Shared Responsibility Model

Understand the division of security responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer. This is a critical concept in cloud security.

## 5. Cloud Security Risks and Challenges

- Data Breaches
- Misconfigurations
- Lack of Visibility
- Insider Threats
