# Week 17 Lab: Setting Up a Cloud Environment

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a free tier account with a major cloud provider.
- Launch a virtual machine in the cloud.
- Configure basic security settings for a cloud environment.
- Connect to a cloud-based virtual machine using SSH.

## 1. Objective

In this lab, you will create a free tier account with a major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and set up a basic cloud environment. This will be the foundation for the labs in this module.

## 2. Requirements

- A valid email address
- A credit card (for verification purposes, you will not be charged if you stay within the free tier limits)

## 3. Steps

1.  **Sign up for a free tier account:**
    - [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
    - [Azure Free Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
    - [GCP Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free)

2.  **Create a virtual machine (VM):**
    - Launch a small VM instance (e.g., t2.micro on AWS, B1s on Azure).
    - Choose a Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu).

3.  **Configure basic security settings:**
    - Create a key pair for SSH access.
    - Configure a security group or network security group (NSG) to allow SSH traffic from your IP address only.

4.  **Connect to your VM:**
    - Use an SSH client to connect to your newly created VM.

## 4. Deliverables

- A screenshot of your running VM in the cloud provider's console.
- The public IP address of your VM.
