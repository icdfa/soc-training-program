## Scenario

You are a Tier 1 SOC Analyst at a fictional company, "SecureCorp." SecureCorp has recently been experiencing a series of suspicious activities, and it is your job to investigate them. You will be provided with a variety of data sources, including network traffic, system logs, and memory dumps. Your goal is to identify the full scope of the attack, from initial compromise to data exfiltration.

## Data Sources

You will be provided with the following data sources:

*   **Network Traffic:** A PCAP file containing network traffic from the compromised network segment.
*   **System Logs:** A collection of Windows Event Logs, firewall logs, and web server logs.
*   **Memory Dumps:** Memory dumps from several compromised systems.

## Tasks

Your tasks are to:

1.  **Analyze the network traffic** to identify suspicious connections and data transfers.
2.  **Analyze the system logs** to identify signs of compromise, such as unauthorized logins and suspicious processes.
3.  **Analyze the memory dumps** to identify malware and other malicious artifacts.
4.  **Correlate the findings** from all data sources to create a complete timeline of the attack.
5.  **Write a comprehensive report** detailing your findings, including:
    *   A timeline of the attack.
    *   A list of all compromised systems.
    *   A list of all malware and tools used by the attacker.
    *   A list of all data that was exfiltrated.
    *   Recommendations for remediation and prevention.

## Deliverables

*   A comprehensive incident response report.
*   A presentation summarizing your findings for a non-technical audience.

## Grading

Your capstone project will be graded on the following criteria:

*   **Thoroughness of your investigation:** Did you identify all of the key artifacts and events?
*   **Accuracy of your findings:** Are your conclusions supported by the evidence?
*   **Clarity of your report:** Is your report well-written and easy to understand?
*   **Effectiveness of your presentation:** Is your presentation clear, concise, and engaging?
