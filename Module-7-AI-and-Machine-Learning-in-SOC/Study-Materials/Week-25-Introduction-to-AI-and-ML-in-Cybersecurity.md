# Week 25: Introduction to AI and ML in Cybersecurity

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Module 7: AI and Machine Learning in SOC! This week, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) and their applications in cybersecurity.

## 2. What is AI and ML?

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## 3. Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Learning from unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through trial and error.

## 4. Applications of AI and ML in SOC

- **Threat Detection:** Identifying malicious activity and anomalies.
- **Alert Prioritization:** Ranking alerts based on their severity and relevance.
- **Automated Response:** Automatically taking action to contain and remediate threats.
- **Threat Hunting:** Proactively searching for unknown threats.
