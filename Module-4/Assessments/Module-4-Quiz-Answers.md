_# Module 4 Quiz: Endpoint Security & Malware Analysis - Answers

1. **What is the primary purpose of an EDR?**
   - An EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solution is a cybersecurity technology that addresses the need for continuous monitoring and response to advanced threats. It is a solution that records and stores endpoint-system-level behaviors, uses data analytics techniques to detect suspicious system behavior, provides contextual information, blocks malicious activity, and provides remediation suggestions to restore affected systems.

2. **What is the difference between static and dynamic malware analysis?**
   - Static malware analysis is the process of analyzing a malware sample without executing it. This is done to identify the malware's capabilities, such as the files it creates, the registry keys it modifies, and the network connections it makes. Dynamic malware analysis is the process of analyzing a malware sample by executing it in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox, to observe its behavior.

3. **What is the purpose of the Volatility framework?**
   - The Volatility Framework is a collection of tools, implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. It is a powerful tool for memory forensics and can be used to extract a wide variety of information from a memory dump, such as running processes, open network connections, and loaded kernel modules.

4. **What is the purpose of a sandbox in malware analysis?**
   - A sandbox is a controlled environment in which a malware sample can be executed to observe its behavior. It is used to prevent the malware from infecting the host system and to contain any damage that it may cause.

5. **What is the difference between a phishing email and a spear phishing email?**
   - A phishing email is a fraudulent email that is sent to a large number of people in an attempt to trick them into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. A spear phishing email is a more targeted form of phishing that is sent to a specific individual or organization. It is often customized to appear as if it is from a trusted source, such as a friend, colleague, or business partner.
