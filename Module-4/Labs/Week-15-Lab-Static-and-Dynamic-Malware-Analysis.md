# Week 15 Lab: Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis

## Objective

In this lab, you will practice both static and dynamic malware analysis on a safe malware sample. You will use the tools you learned about this week to extract information about the malware and understand its behavior.

## Tools

*   PEStudio
*   Strings
*   Cuckoo Sandbox (or a similar online sandbox)

## Malware Sample

For this lab, we will use a safe malware sample from the [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/) database. This is a great resource for malware samples for analysis.

**Sample to download:**

*   Go to [https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/browse/](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/browse/)
*   Search for a sample with the tag `Dridex`.
*   Download the sample. **IMPORTANT:** The password for the archive is `infected`.

**SAFETY WARNING:**

**DO NOT EXECUTE THE MALWARE SAMPLE ON YOUR HOST MACHINE.**

**ONLY EXECUTE THE MALWARE SAMPLE IN YOUR ISOLATED VIRTUAL MACHINE (VM) OR A SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT.**

## Instructions

### Part 1: Static Analysis

1.  **Analyze with PEStudio:**
    *   Open the malware sample in PEStudio.
    *   Examine the file headers, sections, and libraries.
    *   Look for any suspicious indicators.
    *   Take screenshots of your findings.

2.  **Extract Strings:**
    *   Use the `strings` command to extract all printable strings from the malware sample.
    *   Pipe the output to a text file for later analysis.
    *   Look for any interesting strings, such as IP addresses, domain names, or file paths.

### Part 2: Dynamic Analysis

1.  **Analyze with Cuckoo Sandbox:**
    *   Submit the malware sample to your Cuckoo Sandbox instance (or a public sandbox like [any.run](https://any.run/)).
    *   Let the sandbox execute the malware and generate a report.
    *   Analyze the report to understand the malware's behavior.
    *   Look for network connections, file system changes, and registry modifications.

## Deliverables

*   A report summarizing your findings from both static and dynamic analysis.
*   Screenshots of your PEStudio analysis.
*   The text file containing the extracted strings.
*   A link to the Cuckoo Sandbox report (if you used a public sandbox).
*   A list of all Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) you identified.
