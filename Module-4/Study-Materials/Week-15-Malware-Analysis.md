# Week 15: Malware Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to Week 15! This week, we'll dive into the fascinating world of malware analysis. As a SOC analyst, you'll often encounter suspicious files and need to determine if they are malicious. This week, you'll learn the fundamental techniques for analyzing malware in a safe environment.

## Topics

*   **Static Malware Analysis:** Analyzing malware without executing it. This includes examining file properties, strings, and headers.
*   **Dynamic Malware Analysis:** Analyzing malware by executing it in a controlled environment (a sandbox) and observing its behavior.
*   **Malware Analysis Tools:** An overview of popular tools used for malware analysis, such as PEStudio, Ghidra, and Cuckoo Sandbox.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

*   Perform basic static analysis on a malware sample.
*   Perform basic dynamic analysis on a malware sample.
*   Identify key indicators of compromise (IOCs) from malware analysis.
*   Understand the difference between static and dynamic analysis.
