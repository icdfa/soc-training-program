```yara
rule [MalwareName]
{
    meta:
        description = "[Description]"
        author = "[Your Name]"
        date = "[Date]"
        reference = "[Reference URL if any]"
    
    strings:
        $string1 = "[Notable string]" ascii
        $string2 = "[Notable string]" wide
        $api1 = "[API call]" ascii
        
    condition:
        uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and
        filesize < 5MB and
        2 of ($string*, $api*)
}
